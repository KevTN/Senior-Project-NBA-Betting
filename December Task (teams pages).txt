How to edit team pages:
1. SRC
2. Pages
3. Teams
4. Open .js file in studio code and edit the team page

If you want to add a navbar:
1. We have pre-made tables/nav-bar
2. You can use this by:
	import Navbar from "pathname"
	-this would be in "components" folder 

	Example: import Navbar from '../../components/Navbar'

If you build a table or sidebar, navbar, or any type of function. Add it into components and then call it from the components folder like the example above. 

Want to save an image?
SRC -> Images, this folder is dedicated to images


Beighlor & Joseph will work on these team pages.

Divided this up: 
Joseph gets West Coast 
Beighlor gets East Coast

*don't have to worry about players for now. This is just for making the team pages style look nice and getting familiar with react/javascript/css/mui/components folder/
